	abstract = {In periodically driven lattice systems, the effective (Floquet) Hamiltonian can be engineered to be topological; then, the principle of bulk-boundary correspondence guarantees the existence of robust edge states. However, such setups can also host edge states not predicted by the Floquet Hamiltonian. The exploration of such edge states and the corresponding unique bulk topological invariants has only recently begun. In this work we calculate these invariants for chiral symmetric periodically driven one-dimensional systems. We find simple closed expressions for these invariants, as winding numbers of blocks of the unitary operator corresponding to a part of the time evolution. This gives a robust way to tune these invariants using sublattice shifts. We illustrate our ideas on the periodically driven Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, which, as we show, can realize a discrete-time quantum walk; this opens a useful connection between periodically driven lattice systems and discrete-time quantum walks. Our work helps interpret the results of recent simulations where a large number of Floquet Majorana fermions in periodically driven superconductors have been found.},

	abstract = {Topological phases are characterized by edge states confined near the boundaries by a bulk energy gap. On raising temperature, these edge states are typically lost due to mobile thermal excitations. However, disorder can localize an isolated many-body system, potentially allowing for a sharply defined topological phase even in a highly excited state. We explicitly demonstrate this in a model of a disordered, one-dimensional magnet with spin one-half edge excitations. Furthermore, we show that the time evolution of a simple, highly excited state reveals quantum coherent edge spins. In particular, we demonstrate the coherent revival of an edge spin over a time scale that grows exponentially with system size. This is in sharp contrast to the general expectation that quantum bits strongly coupled with a hot many-body system will rapidly lose coherence. This result opens new directions in the study of topologically protected quantum dynamics.},

	abstract = {We consider low-temperature behavior of weakly interacting electrons in disordered conductors in the regime when all single-particle eigenstates are localized by the quenched disorder. We prove that in the absence of coupling of the electrons to any external bath dc electrical conductivity exactly vanishes as long as the temperature T does not exceed some finite value Tc. At the same time, it can be also proven that at high enough T the conductivity is finite. These two statements imply that the system undergoes a finite temperature metal-to-insulator transition, which can be viewed as Anderson-like localization of many-body wave functions in the Fock space. Metallic and insulating states are not different from each other by any spatial or discrete symmetries. We formulate the effective Hamiltonian description of the system at low energies (of the order of the level spacing in the single-particle localization volume). In the metallic phase quantum Boltzmann equation is valid, allowing to find the kinetic coefficients. In the insulating phase, T \&lt; Tc, we use Feynmann diagram technique to determine the probability distribution function for quantum-mechanical transition rates. The probability of an escape rate from a given quantum state to be finite turns out to vanish in every order of the perturbation theory in electron?electron interaction. Thus, electron?electron interaction alone is unable to cause the relaxation and establish the thermal equilibrium. As soon as some weak coupling to a bath is turned on, conductivity becomes finite even in the insulating phase. Moreover, in the vicinity of the transition temperature it is much larger than phonon-induced hopping conductivity of non-interacting electrons. The reason for this enhancement is that the stability of the insulating state is gradually decreasing as the transition point is approached. As a result, a single phonon can cause a whole cascade of electronic hops.},

  abstract={The question whether Anderson insulators can persist to finite-strength interactions?a scenario dubbed many-body localization?has recently received a great deal of interest. The origin of such a many-body localized phase has been described as localization in Fock space, a picture we examine numerically. We then formulate a precise sense in which a single energy eigenstate of a Hamiltonian can be adiabatically connected to a state of a non-interacting Anderson insulator. We call such a state a many - body localized state and define a many-body localized phase as one in which almost all states are many-body localized states. We explore the possible consequences of this; the most striking is an area law for the entanglement entropy of almost all excited states in a many-body localized phase. We present the results of numerical calculations for a one-dimensional system of spinless fermions. Our results are consistent with an area law and, by implication, many-body localization for almost all states and almost all regions for weak enough interactions and strong disorder. However, there are rare regions and rare states with much larger entanglement entropies. Furthermore, we study the implications that many-body localization may have for topological phases and self-correcting quantum memories. We find that there are scenarios in which many-body localization can help to stabilize topological order at non-zero energy density, and we propose potentially useful criteria to confirm these scenarios.}

	abstract = {Quantum phases with different orders exist with or without breaking the symmetry of the system. Recently, a classification of gapped quantum phases which do not break time reversal, parity, or on-site unitary symmetry has been given for 1D spin systems by X. Chen, Z.-C. Gu, and X.-G. Wen [Phys. Rev. B 83, 035107 (2011)]. It was found that such symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases are labeled by the projective representations of the symmetry group which can be viewed as a symmetry fractionalization. In this paper, we extend the classification of 1D gapped phases by considering SPT phases with combined time reversal, parity, and/or on-site unitary symmetries and also the possibility of symmetry breaking. We clarify how symmetry fractionalizes with combined symmetries and also how symmetry fractionalization coexists with symmetry breaking. In this way, we obtain a complete classification of gapped quantum phases in 1D spin systems. We find that in general, symmetry fractionalization, symmetry breaking, and long-range entanglement (present in 2 or higher dimensions) represent three main mechanisms to generate a very rich set of gapped quantum phases. As an application of our classification, we study the possible SPT phases in 1D fermionic systems, which can be mapped to spin systems by Jordan-Wigner transformation.},

They lead to Ward identities and hence to selection rules on amplitudes. Such global symmetries can be coupled to classical background fields and they can be gauged by summing over these classical fields. These generalized global symmetries can be spontaneously broken (either completely or to a sub-group). They can also have 't Hooft anomalies, which prevent us from gauging them, but lead to 't Hooft anomaly matching conditions. Such anomalies can also lead to anomaly inflow on various defects and exotic Symmetry Protected Topological phases. Our analysis of these symmetries gives a new unified perspective of many known phenomena and uncovers new results.",

	abstract = {Periodically driven systems, also known as Floquet systems, can realize symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases that cannot be found in equilibrium. Here, we seek to understand the effects of strong disorder on such SPT phases, working with a one-dimensional Floquet system belonging to Altland-Zirnbauer class BDI. Using the transfer matrix method, we find that the disordered system hosts an array of trivial, topological, and Floquet topological phases. We then explore the phase diagram in the case of uniformly distributed bonds. Our analytic results are confirmed by a numeric computation of the bulk topological invariants. Although all states are generically localized, near phase transitions the localization length of topological edge states diverges. We derive the critical exponents governing these divergences, finding that they take on equilibrium values, despite the fact that we are considering phases unique to non-equilibrium. We also discuss how our work sets the stage for studying interacting Floquet SPT phases.},

We cover topics such as equilibration and thermalisation in pure state statistical mechanics, the eigenstate thermalisation hypothesis, the equivalence of ensembles, non-equilibration dynamics following global and local quenches as well as ramps. We also address initial state independence, absence of thermalisation, and many-body localisation. We elucidate the role played by key concepts for these phenomena, such as Lieb–Robinson bounds, entanglement growth, typicality arguments, quantum maximum entropy principles and the generalised Gibbs ensembles, and quantum (non-)integrability. We put emphasis on rigorous approaches and present the most important results in a unified language.}

In our proposed setup, two internal states of the atoms couple via an optical Raman transition—simultaneously inducing an effective spin-orbit interaction and magnetic field—while a background molecular BEC cloud generates s-wave pairing for the atoms. The resulting cold-atom quantum wire supports Majorana fermions at phase boundaries between topologically trivial and nontrivial regions, as well as “Floquet Majorana fermions” when the system is periodically driven. We analyze experimental parameters, detection schemes, and various imperfections.},

	abstract = {Topological properties of physical systems can lead to robust behaviors that are insensitive to microscopic details. Such topologically robust phenomena are not limited to static systems but can also appear in driven quantum systems. In this paper, we show that the Floquet operators of periodically driven systems can be divided into topologically distinct (homotopy) classes and give a simple physical interpretation of this classification in terms of the spectra of Floquet operators. Using this picture, we provide an intuitive understanding of the well-known phenomenon of quantized adiabatic pumping. Systems whose Floquet operators belong to the trivial class simulate the dynamics generated by time-independent Hamiltonians, which can be topologically classified according to the schemes developed for static systems. We demonstrate these principles through an example of a periodically driven two-dimensional hexagonal lattice tight-binding model which exhibits several topological phases. Remarkably, one of these phases supports chiral edge modes even though the bulk is topologically trivial.},

	abstract = {Topological phases of matter have captured our imagination over the past few years, with tantalizing properties such as robust edge modes and exotic non-Abelian excitations, and potential applications ranging from semiconductor spintronics to topological quantum computation. Despite recent advancements in the field, our ability to control topological transitions remains limited, and usually requires changing material or structural properties. We show, using Floquet theory, that a topological state can be induced in a semiconductor quantum well, initially in the trivial phase. This can be achieved by irradiation with microwave frequencies, without changing the well structure, closing the gap and crossing the phase transition. We show that the quasi-energy spectrum exhibits a single pair of helical edge states. We discuss the necessary experimental parameters for our proposal. This proposal provides an example and a proof of principle of a new non-equilibrium topological state, the Floquet topological insulator, introduced in this paper.},

	abstract = {We show that the Haldane phase of S=1 chains is characterized by a double degeneracy of the entanglement spectrum. The degeneracy is protected by a set of symmetries (either the dihedral group of π rotations about two orthogonal axes, time-reversal symmetry, or bond centered inversion symmetry), and cannot be lifted unless either a phase boundary to another, “topologically trivial,” phase is crossed, or the symmetry is broken. More generally, these results offer a scheme to classify gapped phases of one-dimensional systems. Physically, the degeneracy of the entanglement spectrum can be observed by adiabatically weakening a bond to zero, which leaves the two disconnected halves of the system in a finitely entangled state.},

	Abstract = {Existence of the magnetic monopole is compatible with the fundamental laws of nature; however, this elusive particle has yet to be detected experimentally. We show theoretically that an electric charge near a topological surface state induces an image magnetic monopole charge due to the topological magneto-electric effect. The magnetic field generated by the image magnetic monopole may be experimentally measured, and the inverse square law of the field dependence can be determined quantitatively. We propose that this effect can be used to experimentally realize a gas of quantum particles carrying fractional statistics, consisting of the bound states of the electric charge and the image magnetic monopole charge.},

	abstract = {Recently, several authors have investigated topological phenomena in periodically driven systems of noninteracting particles. These phenomena are identified through analogies between the Floquet spectra of driven systems and the band structures of static Hamiltonians. Intriguingly, these works have revealed phenomena that cannot be characterized by analogy to the topological classification framework for static systems. In particular, in driven systems in two dimensions (2D), robust chiral edge states can appear even though the Chern numbers of all the bulk Floquet bands are zero. Here, we elucidate the crucial distinctions between static and driven 2D systems, and construct a new topological invariant that yields the correct edge-state structure in the driven case. We provide formulations in both the time and frequency domains, which afford additional insight into the origins of the “anomalous” spectra that arise in driven systems. Possibilities for realizing these phenomena in solid-state and cold-atomic systems are discussed.},

@article{Stern08,
	Abstract = {The dichotomy between fermions and bosons is at the root of many physical phenomena, from metallic conduction of electricity to super-fluidity, and from the periodic table to coherent propagation of light. The dichotomy originates from the symmetry of the quantum mechanical wave function to the interchange of two identical particles. In systems that are confined to two spatial dimensions particles that are neither fermions nor bosons, coined ``anyons'', may exist. The fractional quantum Hall effect offers an experimental system where this possibility is realized. In this paper we present the concept of anyons, we explain why the observation of the fractional quantum Hall effect almost forces the notion of anyons upon us, and we review several possible ways for a direct observation of the physics of anyons. Furthermore, we devote a large part of the paper to non-abelian anyons, motivating their existence from the point of view of trial wave functions, giving a simple exposition of their relation to conformal field theories, and reviewing several proposals for their direct observation. },

New data are presented for the surface width and the surface skewness of Eden clusters grown on a square lattice. The width depends on the average orientation of the surface with respect to the underlying lattice. Its corrections to scaling are discussed. The skewness has unexpected changes of sign.}
