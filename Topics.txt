88 Confinement                    —— Skinner
   Open ended
   What is it?
     Non-Abelian gauge thy w/ group G
     Gauge fields interact, even without matter
     Coupling runs with energy scale, large in IR
     But then we can't do perturbation theory!
     If we add (not too much matter), thory is confining
       All states are in singlet representation
     But beta function comes from perturbation theory…
   We want a more precise notion
   Toy models in low dimensions
     E&M in 1+1d
       No interesting solution to vacuum equations
       With point charge, electric field is step function
         Energy diverges
       But you can have two charges! (charge—anticharge)
         But energy is linear in charge seperation (flux tube)
         Confining in IR
         Check this is still true QM *
     CP^{N-1} model
       Gauge theory with N complex scalars, broken scalar symmetry
       Minimum of action is S^{2N-1} \in C^N
       With guage transformations we get CP^{N-1}=S^{2N-1}/U(1)
       Should have low energy description as NLSM
       Shockingly, the low energy limit is confining
       Also solvable in N->∞
   Wilson loops
     Gauge invariant way to create quark-antiquark pair at different locations
     Instead do M = \bar(q(x))U(x,y)q(y)
       Can't always satisfy D_μU=0
       But can do v^μD_μU=0
     U(x,y)→g(x)U(x,y)g(y)
     Consider quantum expectation of M(x,y)U(T)M(x,y)
       Move quark from x to y, evolve for T, move back from y to x
       Alternatively make pair at time 0, then remove at time T
       Should be proportional to exp(-E(R)T)
       Theory is contining if E(R)∼R
     More generally, expectation of Wilson loop for closed curve
       ∼perimeter: nonconfining
       ∼area:      confining
   't Hooft dual superconductor
     Meissner effect B field expelled from superconductor
       True up to critical value
       Then you get two behaviors
         Type 1) fat tube of magnetic vortex lines
         Type 2) vortex lines repel
     Lines in type 2 look like flux tubes in confining phase
     This duality is the EM duality

92 Chiral Fermions on the Lattice —— Tong
   Weyl Fermions
   Hard to put them on a lattice
   Essay will be in 3+1, easier to explain in d=1+1
     Clifford algebra has two elements
       \gamma^0= \sigma^1
       \gamma^1=i\sigma^2
       \gamma^3= \sigma^3
     Massless fermions travel at the speed of light
       in 1+1, one Weyl fermion is left-moving, the other is right-moving
       Dispersion relation: E=p and E=-p with negative energies filled
       Left and right are seperately conserved
     Massive fermions
       Dispersion is a hyperbola with gap E=mc^2
     What happens in discrete space?
       Momentum becomes periodic (Brillouin zone)
       Chiral symmetry is broken
         But dispersion has to be smooth at the periodic point
       Single chiral fermion gets sine-valued dispersion
         Creates another massless fermion with other chirality
   Back to 3+1
     Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem (1st part of essay)
   What's the problem?
     We live in a universe with chiral symmetry of Weyl fermions
   Ways around
     Chiral symmetry—overlap fermions (kinda hard)
     Chiral perticles—Lattice with a boundary
       Can have chiral fermions in 1+1 as edge of 2+1
       Same thing with 3+1 on edge of 4+1 lattice
         Kaplan & Grabowska 1610.02151
       Use interactions to give masses to unwanted fermion
         Eichten & Preskill (1986)
         Xiao-Gang Wen 1305.1045
         You, Bentov & Xu 1402.4151
         Suggestion that it's possible in 3+1
           if you have N*16 unwanted fermions


98 Instantons                     ——Dorey
   Localized in spacetime, not just space like solitons
   Path Integrals 
     Paths are weighted by action of path
     Coupling looks like hbar
     Higher Feynman diagrams are higher orders of coupling
   Normal integral of e^{-1/g^2 f(x)}
     Global minimum and local minima
     Looks like sum of contributions at each minimum, weighted by second derivative
     Within each sector can develop perturbation theory
     Same applies to QFT
   Configurations that "stationarize" Euclidean action
     Solutions of classical EoM
     \phi(x)=\phi_cl(x)
     Also want finite action (decays at infinity?)
     Called instantons
   Non-abelian gauge theory — SU(2)
     L_YM = 1/g^2 tr{F_mnF^mn} (Killing form is just trace)
     Lagrangian is action density — Should decay
     Field has to go to pure gauge U^dag \partial_\mu U
       U is map from \boundary R^4 = S^3 to SU(2) = S^3
       These maps have winding number \pi_3(S^3) = Z
       Seperate sectors in field space set by winding number
     Winding number k = 1/(16pi^2) \int tr{F*F}
     Something else
       \int tr{(F\pm*F)^2} \ge 0
       Equality iff F = \pm *F
       Gives bound on action S_E \ge 8pi^2|k|
     k-instanton
       F^mn = (\sigma^mn l^2)/(|x-X|^2 - l^2) (k=1)
       Something about moduli space
       dim[M_k] = 8k
   Interesting connections

       Dirac operator \slashD
       \slashD \lambda_a = 0

         One photon and two massive gauge bosons
